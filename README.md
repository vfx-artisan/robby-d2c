Robby D2C (Data to Content) Solution.

Meet Robby
Robby D2C (Data to Content) is a smart automated solution that delivers rich content from data. From daily weather forecasts to hourly statistics, Robby can collect a variety of information and turns it into rich, custom-designed content.

How does Robby work?
In short, Robby collects data from a specific source, prepares it, and passes it to Adobe Creative Cloud™ to produce the content. Once the content is ready, Robby will then upload it to Dropbox™ and generate a download link, which is shared in an email.
